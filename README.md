## Overview
This project visualizes disparities in access to licensed mental health professionals across the United States. Using state-level data from HRSA's AHRF 2022–2023 release, the dashboard highlights variations in psychologist availability relative to population size. 

The goal is to identify which states are underserved and to provide a visual tool for policymakers and health equity advocates.

## Focus Areas
- Compare state populations to the number of licensed psychologists
- Rank states by population-to-provider ratio
- Identify underserved states with disproportionately low mental health workforce density
- Raise awareness of behavioral health access gaps in the U.S.

## Key Insights
- Some large-population states have fewer providers per capita than smaller ones
- Several rural states show critical shortages in psychologist access
- States with high mental illness prevalence often lack corresponding workforce investment
